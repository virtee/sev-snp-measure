# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Add `--vmm-type=gce` to calculate SNP measurements according to the GCE
  (Google Compute Engine) VMM (by [@joao-hs](https://github.com/joao-hs)).

## 0.0.11 - 2024-06-18

### Modified
- Support OVMF section `SVSM_CAA` (fix `ValueError: 4 is not a valid
  SectionType`) (by [@DGonzalezVillal](https://github.com/DGonzalezVillal)).

## 0.0.10 - 2024-05-24

### Modified
- Set default of `--guest-features` back to 0x1 to align with
  Linux kernel 6.8 and newer ([kernel commit 5abf6dceb066](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5abf6dceb066f2b02b225fd561440c98a8062681)) (by
  [@larrydewey](https://github.com/larrydewey)).
- Update the VMSA to match latest upstream kernel; this should match
  host Linux kernel 6.10 and newer; this is a **BREAKING CHANGE** for older
  kernels (by [@DGonzalezVillal](https://github.com/DGonzalezVillal)).
- Updated dependencies: cryptography to 42.0.4, removed unneeded
  types-cryptography (by [@msanft](https://github.com/msanft)).

## 0.0.9 - 2024-02-09

### Added
- Add optional `--vars-file` (besides `--vars-size`) for SNP-SVSM mode (by
  [@osteffenrh](https://github.com/osteffenrh)).
- Add optional `--guest-features` to set the value of the SEV features field in
  the VMSA.  This value is set to 0x1 by host Linux kernel older than 6.6, and
  to 0x21 (the default) in later kernels.  Note that this is a **BREAKING
  CHANGE** for kernels older than 6.6 (run with `--guest-features=0x1` to get
  the correct behaviour there).

### Modified
- Updated dependencies: cryptography to 42.0.0

## 0.0.8 - 2024-02-01

### Added
- Add `--mode=snp:svsm` to calculate SNP measurements when starting with SVSM
  under QEMU (by [@osteffenrh](https://github.com/osteffenrh)).
- Add `--dump-vmsa` to write measured VMSAs to local files for debugging (by
  [@osteffenrh](https://github.com/osteffenrh)).

### Modified
- Fix bad id-auth signature generation (by [@shuk777](https://github.com/shuk777)).
- Verify keys given to snp-create-id-block are EC P-384 keys (by [@shuk777](https://github.com/shuk777)).

## 0.0.7 - 2023-06-27

### Modified
- Github repository moved to the [VirTEE](https://github.com/virtee) organization.

## 0.0.6 - 2023-06-12

### Added
- Add `--vmm-type=ec2` to calculate SNP measurements according to the EC2 VMM,
  which is slightly different than the way QEMU measures the initial VM state
  (by [@agraf](https://github.com/agraf)).

### Modified
- Detect OVMF that doesn't support kernel hashes and exit with error.
- Exit with error if `--initrd`/`--append` are used without `--kernel`.

## 0.0.5 - 2023-04-13

### Modified
- Modify SNP measured direct boot to match the order of measured pages in QEMU
  for the [March 2023 patches (v3)](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230302092347.1988853-1-dovmurik@linux.ibm.com/)
  for SNP measured boot.  Note that this is a **BREAKING CHANGE** if you use
  `--kernel` (that is, the calculated measurement will be different when compared
  to v0.0.4).

## 0.0.4 - 2023-04-13

### Added
- Add `--mode=snp:ovmf-hash` and `--snp-ovmf-hash` to allow precalculating the
  first part of SNP launch digest and avoid carrying the full OVMF binary for
  every minor OVMF change (by [@agraf](https://github.com/agraf)).
- Add new utility `snp-create-id-block` which allows generating an SNP ID block
  from a given measurement (by [@shuk777](https://github.com/shuk777)).

## 0.0.3 - 2022-05-17

### Added
- Add `--output-format={hex,base64}` to control the measurement output format
  (default is hex)
- For SEV-ES and SNP: Add guest CPU type choice using `--vcpu-type` or
  `--vcpu-sig` or `--vcpu-family/--vcpu-model/--vcpu-stepping`
- Add SEV (`--mode=sev`) and SEV-ES (`--mode=seves`) measurement modes
- Add `--verbose` for verbose output; by default, only the digest is printed
- Improve README

## 0.0.2 - 2022-04-11

### Added
- Initial version
